# Proyectos Molones

**Proyectos Molones** is a virtual library for storing and showcasing technology-related projects. It's designed as a clean, component-based React application with a smooth user experience and modern styling using SCSS.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is the first front-end iteration of the app, built by a team of five developers, for the first part. The main goal is to provide a place where users can save and display tech projects in an organized and visually appealing way.

## 🔍 Features

Currently, the application consists of **three main pages**:

1. **Landing Page**  
   - Displays a collection of project cards with the information of all submitted projects.
   - Projects are shown in a responsive card layout.

2. **Form Page**  
   - Allows users to submit a new project through a dynamic form.
   - Fields include: project name, author, relevant links, description, technologies used, and more.
   - As the form is being filled out, a **real-time preview card** updates live to reflect the current input.

3. **Project Detail Page**  
   - Once a project is submitted, users are redirected to a standalone page displaying the full project card with all the submitted data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** – Front-end framework
- **Vite** – Build tool for fast development and hot module replacement
- **SCSS** – Styling and layout
- **JSON** – Used to simulate project data storage (temporary stand-in for database)
- **Component-based architecture** – Clean separation of concerns
- **(Back-end functionality is not yet implemented)**

## 🚧 Coming Soon

- Integration with a back-end to store and retrieve project data.

## 👥 Team

This initial version was developed by a team of 5 members as part of a collaborative project. The codebase is well-structured and uses reusable React components for better scalability and maintainability.
